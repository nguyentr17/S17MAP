>> # Use boxplot and   \
   #  << F-test\
# Pull the coffee truck data with R code: how to pull multiple .csv data together\
>> # Add color by the facet by\
>> # create side-by-side R-markdown graphs to see where some lurking variable can be wrong: where\
  # you need 3-4 variables instead of just two\
# label1: age, athlete, attempt, [color], dominant hand, major\
>> # add group ID\
# give the user the choice to change y limit\
# variable 3 and variable 4 (use the ones in labels)\
# have an output of n used (number of observations)\
# add a menu/option for the user to choose "Filter data by"\
# Goal: to see whether we can see things in graphs \
  # (proximity and time may be very important by timer or number of of pieces\
# add an option to log and unlog the time\
# add a y limit to the data (may delete variable that took longer than 4 minutes)\
>> # convert milliseconds to minutes \
# change the thickness and see through to the timerDisplayed data\
# look at proximity value by number of pieces (a 3rd var)\
# have a look-up buttion for user to type in different factors\
# create a times river thing}
