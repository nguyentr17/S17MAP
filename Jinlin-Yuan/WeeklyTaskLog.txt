———— //Check
Compare same variable ID but different group ID to see how different small groups can get different mean/p-value/linear models
	*use 'startWith' to extract group ID
	(e.g. #see if there is a significant difference between gender in all groups with n <= 50 or so. so is there a difference in gender or not)

———— 
Update filter no. 5 from Dennis-Trang code

———— //Check
indicate sample size on graph

———— //Check but look really ugly
overlaying jitter plot and boxplot (transparency)

———— //Check, See Gender_Test.RMD
highlight/present examples that might be misleading

————
use 'time per shape'

Create a .rmd file
In the file, use Untimed data-frame
Create graphs //Check
	y-variable: TimePerShape, NumErrorPerShape
	x-variable: matchingScheme
	
	y-variable: TimePerShape, NumErrorPerShape
	x-variable: matchingScheme
	color-by  : timerDisplay
For each graph, create linear regression//Check
Record coefficients and R^2

Repeat the procedure with filtered data
Filter data by group ID
	most represented groupID
	Grinnell groupID: MAT209, MAT336


————
slider bar for range to include/exclude outlier

————
slider bar to customize sample size

————
Change factor-level names: matchingscheme

————
Linear regression numShapes vs. timeUsed, and then see what happens if we break down by matchingScheme. Add p-value and see how p-value changes when sample-size/ w/wo matching / ... change
