Weekly Task Log

Week2(Jan 31 2017)
#Use the updated code to filter data by factor (e.g. gender)
#Compare same variable ID but different group ID to see how different small groups can get different mean/p-value/linear models
	*use 'startWith' to extract group ID
	(e.g. #see if there is a significant difference between gender in all groups with n <= 50 or so. so is there a difference in 			gender or not)
#Update filter no. 5 from Dennis-Trang code
#indicate sample size on graph
#overlapping jitter plot and boxplot (transparency)
#highlight/present examples that might be misleading
#use 'time per shape'
#sliderbar for range to include/exclude outlier
#sliderbar to customize sample size
#Change factor-level names: matchingscheme
#Linear regression numShapes vs. timeUsed, and then see what happens if we break down by matchingScheme. Add p-value and see how p-value 	changes when sample-size/ w/wo matching / ... change
